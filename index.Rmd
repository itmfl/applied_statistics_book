# Preface {-}
Advanced praise for the book

> "When I was young, I would rather write a (linear model) book than read one. But now that I am older, I would rather write two (linear model) books than read one."
>
> --- R. H. Bing

> "I was at the job of reading it for days and days, endlessly daunted and halted by its laborious dullness, its flatulent fatuity, its almost fabulous inconsequentiality."
>
> --- Mencken
